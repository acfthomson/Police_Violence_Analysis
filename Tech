##Data Cleaning and Analysis
Postgres SQL will be used for data cleaning and anlyzing our data. Additionally, Python (Pandas) may also be used to further explore our data. 
##Data Storage
Our data will be stored in AWS.
##Machine Learning
SciKitLearn will be used to create and test our machine learning model. Our ML model will test a predictive statistic.
##Visualization
Tableau will be used to visualize our analysis. Our unique data will be visualized in a simplified manner so all stakeholders will be able to access the validity of our data. Data will be presented in a story format.
